Step Response Install       Folder containing installation software
                            for simulating a system's step response       
Root Locus Install          Folder containing installation software
                            for a program to perform root locus and
                            frequency response calculations

INSTRUCTIONS
On order to run the programs you must have a PC with at least 
Windows 95. To install the programs open the respective file (step response 
or root locus) and double-click the "setup" icon. Then follow the 
instructions on the screen. 

Specific instructions to use each program is now presented.

Step Response:
1. After installing the software, the program can be selected
from Control Systems Engineering under Programs in the Start menu.
2. When the Step Response window appears, Enter the order of the
system.
3. Enter the components of the A, B, C matrix of a system
represented in state space. 
4. Enter the initial conditions.
5. Enter an iteration interval.
6. Enter a print interval that is larger than the interation 
interval.
7. Enter the total time you want the simulation to run.
8. Click on the calculate button.
9. A plot of the step response and data points are displayed
in the output window.

Root Locus and Frequency Response
1. After installing the software, the Root Locus and Frequency 
Response program can be selected from Control Systems Engineering under 
Programs in the Start menu.
2. When the Root Locus and Frequency Response window appears, 
Enter the number of poles and the number of zeros.
3. Enter the values of the poles and zeros.
4. Select the coordinate system in which you will be entering 
test points - polar or Cartesian. 
5. Enter the test point.
6. Click on the calculate button and read the angle, 
magnitude, and gain.

Appendix H contains more information about the two programs including 
sample screens with input and output data.
