%% Changing Transparency
% This example shows how to modify the transparency value for graphics
% objects to reveal structure that is obscured with opaque objects.  For
% patches and surfaces, use the |FaceAlpha| and |EdgeAlpha| properties to
% specify the transparency of faces and edges.

%% A Transparent Isosurface
% The |flow| function generates data for the speed profile of a submerged jet
% within an infinite tank.  One way to visualize this data is by creating an
% isosurface illustrating where the rate of flow is equal to a specified value.

cla
[x, y, z, v] = flow;
% Compute and create a patch object from data created from the isosurface with a 
% isosurface scalar value of -3
p = patch(isosurface(x,y,z,v,-3));
% Get the normals to the isosurface based on the gradients of v - scalar values
% at the x,y,z coordinate
isonormals(x,y,z,v,p);
set(p,'facecolor','red','edgecolor','none');
daspect([1 1 1]);

% Add a light source to the scene to give the surface more definition.

% Apply smooth rather than faceted shading by changing lighting from
% default 'flat' to 'gouraud'.
lighting gouraud;

% Adding transparency to the isosurface reveals that there is greater complexity
% in the fluid flow than is visible using the opaque surface.  The statement
% |alpha(0.5)| sets the |FaceAlpha| value for the isosurface face to 0.5.

alpha(0.5)


%% A Texture Map
% The |MAT| file |topo.mat| has color data representing the different continents on
% the globe.  This example shows how to map this data onto the surface of a sphere. 
%
% The |sphere| function generates coordinates of a sphere.  Setting the 
% |cdata| property of the |surface| object to |topo| maps the 
% color data contained in |topo| for each continent onto the surface of the sphere. In 
% addition, the |facecolor| property needs to be set to |texturemap| if the 
% size of the _z_-data is different from the size of the cdata 
% MATLAB(R) then  fills in the color at _z_-data points where the color is 
% not specified using interpolation.  
% The software can also map the color data onto the surface if you specify 
% the |facealpha| transparency property to be of type |texture|.  If this
% property is not specified, the globe will not be transparent.  Other
% options for |facealpha| are available.  Search for |facealpha texture| in
% the doc for more information.
